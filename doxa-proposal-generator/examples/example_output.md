## 1. Executive Summary

DOXA proposes a tailored AI automation solution for Farmbora Ltd operating in the Agriculture sector. The engagement addresses the core challenge of Manual order processing takes 3 days and leads to frequent errors, causing customer complaints and revenue ... by replacing manual workflows with an intelligent, integrated system — reducing operational cost, eliminating errors, and positioning Farmbora Ltd for scalable growth across the continent.

## 2. Problem Analysis

**Current situation at Farmbora Ltd:**

Orders come in via WhatsApp, staff manually enters them into Excel spreadsheets, then emails invoices one by one. Follow-ups are tracked on paper.

**Key pain points identified:**

- High dependency on manual effort, leading to delays and human error.
- Limited visibility into real-time operational data.
- Inability to scale the current process beyond 500 monthly customer interactions without proportionally increasing headcount.
- Risk of revenue leakage due to inconsistent follow-up and invoicing.

## 3. Proposed AI Automation Solution

**Desired outcome:** Automated order intake from WhatsApp, auto-generated invoices, real-time inventory sync with their warehouse system, and automated payment reminders

DOXA will deliver an end-to-end automation layer that integrates directly with Farmbora Ltd's existing tools and communication channels. The solution includes:

1. **Intelligent Intake Engine** — Captures orders, enquiries, or requests from WhatsApp, web forms, and email using natural-language processing.
2. **Workflow Orchestrator** — Routes each request through configurable business rules (approval chains, SLA timers, escalation paths).
3. **Document Generator** — Auto-creates invoices, quotes, and reports in branded PDF format.
4. **Analytics Dashboard** — Real-time KPIs, conversion funnels, and exception alerts accessible via web and mobile.
5. **Integration Hub** — Connects to ERP, accounting software, CRM, and payment gateways already in use.
